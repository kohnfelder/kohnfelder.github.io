<h3 id="takas-shrin" title="#takas-shrin">Takasu shrine</h3>
<p>This shrine at the foot of Mount Takasu is the oldest wooden structure
still standing in Fukuoka Prefecture. Famous for the 
<a href="https://itoshima-now.com/en/event/takasu-night-kagura-shinto-dance-oct2025/">night time <em>kagura</em> traditional dance</a>.</p>
<p>Ancient paintings hung around the ceiling of the main shrine building are
designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan.
It's remarkable that they are safe there both from the elements and from
thieves in this old unattended building that is quite open to the weather.</p>

<h3 id="mori-to" title="#mori-to">Mori to Coffee</h3>
<p>We visited another coffee roaster quite off the beaten path:
<a href="https://moritocoffe.thebase.in/"><em>Mori to Ko-hi-</em></a> "forest and coffee".</p>
<p><img alt="Morito" src="https://base-ec2.akamaized.net/images/shop_front/moritocoffe/d4b01dd3bb0938bafbc8bb9f608b3ab6.jpg" /></p>
<p>Not a cafe, coffee is served free of charge for tasting, they only sell
coffee and some related goods. The owner quit his everyday job 
(the Japanese <em>das-sara</em> expression "detaching from work" implies
determination to make a radical and irreversible change)
years ago and made a new life building this business. </p>
<p>On the website 
<a href="https://moritocoffe.thebase.in/blog/2022/08/05/131610">he writes</a>
of a long-held wish "to live the way I wanted to live."
Open from noon only four days a week (so he has plenty of free time)
somehow they get enough business in this remote location to make
the business work. It certainly looks like he is living his wish.</p></section>

<h3 id="itosaisai" title="#itosaisai">Ito-sai-sai</h3>
<p>JA (Japan Agriculture, the quasi-government organization supporting
farmers here with co-ops, stores, and other resources) operations
<a href="https://ja-itoshima.or.jp/itosaisai/">Ito-sai-sai</a> which is a local
treasure selling produce of all kinds direct to consumers from the
farmers and fishermen.</p>
<p>It's like a large supermarket (large by Japanese standards, medium
by American) however everything sold is locally produced, and most of
the store contents sell out by the end of the day. Crowded at opening
because that's when you can buy the best products which sell out quickly,
people flock here for the best local produce at the best prices.
Many restaurant owners shop here for the same reasons, so it's quite
crowded from opening into late afternoon. </p></section>

<h3 id="fish-lunch" title="#fish-lunch">Fish lunch</h3>
<p>We drove by a little restaurant several times on our way into town
and it looked interesting, so we went for a late lunch.
The name <em>Maru-TA</em> means circle-TA (タ); putting one character in a circle
is a common sort of simple logo used as shop names here (perhaps the owner's
last name begins with <em>ta</em>).
It did not disappoint. </p>
<p><img alt="Maru-TA exterior" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gps-cs-s/AC9h4nqoncmHjwDHgvxdCK1mVpGtB1eZbRUtABLPq4CboQ83Ib01AP7HNJdqEP9_nUSDPnl6nAiTb-Cg25ebo_GgkDOURCZyahxxdEyMj7RJYJvNb0o5ic-LMN3qLQ9ab1LVuzLsltfN=w446-h448-n-k-no-nu" /></p>
<p>A sign on the door says they are only open for reservations, but luckily
we had called ahead to check if they were open (no website).
Half the interior of the place is taken up with fish tanks,
leaving limited space for dining that maybe seats 20.
There is no menu: lunch choices are <em>sashimi</em> lunch or special lunch
which is the <em>sashimi</em> lunch plus stewed or fried fish.</p>

<p>This is the kind of place I love in Japan that you couldn't possibly
find anywhere. The humble decor is all about having the freshest fish;
a couple run the place with dedication and smiles;
six kinds of <em>sashimi</em> and three other kinds fried, 
with rice and miso soup and <em>tsukemono</em> (pickles).
About $20/person, no tip of course.</p></section>
