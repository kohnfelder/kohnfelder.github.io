<h2 id="chiku-stati" title="#chiku-stati">Chikuzen-Maebaru station</h2>
<p>We are staying out near the rural areas of Itoshima where public transit
is very limited (a long walk to the nearest bus stop, 
and the interval between busses could be an hour) - quite like Kaua‘i
actually. However, it's not <em>that far</em> and today was nice weather for a
walk (moderate temperature and overcast) so I did the 10km walk to get
a feel for the area you cannot get riding through in a car.</p>
<p>Flat land in Itoshima is almost all either developed (homes or commercial use)
or farmed, with very little wasted space. Along my route to the station
I passed many rice paddies, mostly already cut but a few ready for harvest.</p>

<p>In Japanese 米（こめ <em>kome</em>） is the food rice, but the plant is 稲（いね <em>ine</em>）.
Most harvesting is done by machine and processed industrially these days,
but a few farmers operate traditionally, cutting the stalks near the ground
and hanging them in the field to dry before knocking off the rice kernels.</p>

<p>Many fields have a narrow band of flowers as a border along the road.
Cosmos are popular, and often it's sunflowers.
I assume these were planted years ago and naturally sustain themselves.
It's a very nice touch.</p></section>

<p>I found another small coffee roaster in town, 
<a href="https://coffee-sazanami.com/">Sazanami coffee</a>.
Mr Urakawa has a 1kg infrared heater roaster in the back of the shop
producing several blends and single origin coffees.</p>
<p>We talked about coffee roasting and I shared some Kauai Roastery
coffee I'd brought as gifts.</p></section>
