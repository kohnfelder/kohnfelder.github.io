<p><em>NOTE: The following is based on my casual following of political events, not to be mistaken for expert opinion.</em></p>
<p>Today the Diet elected 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanae_Takaichi">Sanae Takaichi</a> 
to be Japan's next prime minister after months of political machinations.</p>
<p><img alt="election" src="https://media.infosec.exchange/infosec.exchange/cache/media_attachments/files/115/411/014/063/640/654/original/5e9355cadac4fe62.webp" title="Takaichi officially elected prime minister" /></p>
<p>Takaichi leads the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that has dominated
post-war politics in Japan but recently fallen in popularity losing its
majority in the Diet a few years ago and struggling ever since with
persistent accusations of improper financial transactions.</p>
<p>Outgoing prime minister Ishiba has continued to lose power and decline
since being elected but resisted resigning and stubbornly clung to the
office, which has delayed and complicated the process of choosing a successor.
Takaichi won the party presidency over a month ago - usually this would
automatically mean becoming prime minister - except the coalition with the
Komeito party that allowed Ishiba to gain a majority soon faltered.</p>
<p>Eventually Takaichi forged a new coalition with the 
Japan Innovation Party (日本維新の会）to procure the necessary votes
to beome prime minister. 
According to reporting cabinet seats were offered to the coalition
partner but were declined (perhaps because the relatively new party members
are relatively inexperienced, or perhaps due to lack of confidence in the
new government).</p>
<p>With the political maneuvering behind here, not PM Takaichi will get to work
and we will see if the new government delivers results or not.</p></section>
