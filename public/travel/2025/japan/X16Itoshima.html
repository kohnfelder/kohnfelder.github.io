<p>We have a lovely rental house in Itoshima on the waterfront
(<a href="https://www.lana-sea-itoshima.com/">Lana-Sea</a>).
Like our home it's designed for the view with the main area on the 
second floor with an open loft above, with bedrooms and bath below.</p>

<p>Itoshima is an unique area: lots of agriculture and fishing,
coastal areas are famous for oysters, and also in recent years
there is an active community of artists and craftspersons working here.
Kyuushuu University expanded out of Fukuoka into Itoshima with a large
campus built out on the side near the city.</p>
<p>This part of Japan is directly opposite the Korean peninsula so people
has been here since ancient times including much trade and travel.
The Fukuoka city subway Airport Line extends out into Itoshima, but public
transit is scarce beyond that in this very rural area.</p>
<p>Went for an afternoon walk around the area following along the coast,
looping back through farm land. Most of the open land is farmed either in
rice (by now mostly, but not all harvested) or vegetables (eggplant, potatoes,
green onions, and many more).</p>
