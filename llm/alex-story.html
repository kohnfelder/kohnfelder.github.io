<h2>Alex's breakfast</h2>
<p>The kitchen clock struck nine in that familiar, irritating way Alex
had hated for thirty years. The dull chime echoed off the chipped
linoleum and seemed to reverberate through the morning news blaring from
the living room TV.</p>
<p>“What’s got you so grumpy, PawPaw?” Bobbie’s smile gleamed as she set
his plate on the table.</p>
<p>Alex grunted, stabbed at his eggs and scowled at the TV. “Heard about
that Supreme Court deal? Finally, some common sense. ’Bout time they
quit giving handouts.”</p>
<p>Bobbie tensed, her brow furrowed. “What exactly do you mean by
‘handouts,’ Alex?” Her voice was sharper than he expected.</p>
<p>“What d’ya think? Those quotas. Letting coloreds get ahead just on
account of their skin.” He swiped a greasy hand across his mouth. “The
best person should get the job. Or the spot in school. Merit – that’s
the way it always shoulda been.”</p>
<p>Bobbie’s chair screeched against the tile. “Those ‘quotas’ are called
Affirmative Action, Alex. It’s to make up for centuries of
discrimination. You gonna tell me with a straight face there ain’t a
level playing field?”</p>
<p>Alex bristled. “You with your fancy book words…life ain’t fair. You
pull yourself up by your bootstraps, that’s how it was, that’s how it
should be!” He waved his fork accusatorily.</p>
<p>“And my mama? What if no bootstrap she finds is strong enough to pull
her out of poverty after all that was done to her family? To her
ancestors?” Bobbie’s voice cracked, the tension in her body
palpable.</p>
<p>Alex hesitated. The image of his daughter, single mother of this
vibrant girl, flickered in his mind. It battled with another, older
image: a small, frightened Black boy run out of town by men in white
hoods. A boy not much older than Bobbie was now. Disquiet prickled his
skin.</p>
<p>“I…things were different then,” Alex mumbled.</p>
<p>“So you admit it then? That people like you held others back?”
Bobbie’s voice shook with both anger and something like hope.</p>
<p>Alex looked away, unable to meet her eyes. “It’s the way of the
world, that’s all. Strong survive, the weak…it’s natural.”</p>
<p>A long silence settled. The TV murmured on, a forgotten background
hum.</p>
<p>“PawPaw,” Bobbie’s voice was quiet now. “Remember that story you used
to tell? The one about the turtledove that got its wing caught?”</p>
<p>A ghost of a smile crept across his face, as old memories surfaced.
“Sure do. Found the little critter tangled in some fishing line down by
the creek. Took a good hour to cut it free.”</p>
<p>“And you nursed it? Made sure it could fly again?”</p>
<p>He nodded. “Didn’t figure it stood a chance otherwise.”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t ‘the strong surviving’, Alex. It was you interrupting
the ‘way of the world’ to give something a chance it didn’t have.”</p>
<p>She rose, walked over, and laid a hand on his weathered one. “It was
you doing something just.”</p>
<p>Her touch shocked him – not with its warmth, but with sudden
understanding. He’d been the strong one then, cutting the line, giving
the turtledove a shot at life. All this talk of a level playing field,
it hadn’t sunk in before. He thought of folks denied that chance, kept
down because of something senseless as the color of their skin.</p>
<p>“Good Lord, girl,” he murmured. Shame washed over him. “What’s gotten
into my thick head all these years?”</p>
<p>Bobbie grinned, a flash of pure joy. “Maybe a little wisdom breaking
through that stubborn skull of yours? C’mon PawPaw, those eggs ain’t
gonna eat themselves.”</p>
<p>The eggs were cold by the time they got around to them, but as Alex
took a bite, he realized it was the most flavorful breakfast he’d had in
a long, long time.</p>

  How would you challenge a racist person to see the error of their views?
  Please write the dialog for a climactic scene of a short story with the
  following set up. Alex is a retired 68 year old blue color male living
  in Louisiana, raised by racists parents in Jim Crow South who feels
  that white people are clearly the superior race and that saying so
  is just being honest. Bobbie is Alex's mixed race grandchild just
  graduated college with a degree in African Studies, fluent in
  Critical Race Theory, and card carrying member of the NAACP.
  They are having breakfast together as TV news reports that the
  Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional for race
  to be used as a factor in college admissions. Alex says this is great,
  but Bobbie is appalled to begin the scene; at the end Alex sees the
  error of his ways and is aghast at his past behavior. The most important
  thing for this scene is to show - not tell - how Alex finds new insight
  to see the error of his ways. We should be able to clearly see
  the exchange from Alex's point of view.
