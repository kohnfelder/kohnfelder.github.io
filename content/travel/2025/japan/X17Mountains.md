## Mountains

Thursday we drove around the mountains we see from the house looking north,
across the water and beyond.

### 雷山千如寺 Raizan-sennyo temple

In the morning we visited this major temple of the Daikakuji sect of
the Shingon branch of Japanese Buddhism. 
Driving out of town as we ascend into the mountains climbing a narrow valley
with all arable land planted mostly in rice.
The road winds as it rises with isolated homes sprinkled in with the fields.

We arrived in time to observe *goma-taki* ceremony which centers on
burning prayers for patrons (for good health, prosperity, safety, and so on)
as an act of causing them to be fulfilled. 
Several priests conducted the ceremony in the smoky darkened room
(photography strictly prohibited) with chanting, drumming, and culminating in
reading off people's names for good fortune. 
Afterward we lined up to pay respects to the large *kannon* statue
and receive tapping with a stick from the head priest to bless us.
(When tapped as the only foreigner there I thought I'd done something wrong.)

Beautiful gardens surround the sprawling buildings that comprise the temple.

The 500 *rakan* are a remarkable collection of statues of spiritual masters
said to be based on the 500 followers of the Buddha.
I'm no authority on the history or meaning but can only testify that
the diversity of faces, expressions, and poses is captivating to observe.

### 白糸滝 Shiraito falls

Next we went to the Shiraito Falls, nearby but with the windy mountain
roads and no direct route is was about 30 minutes drive to get there. Just a
short walk from the parking area, the morning light made for a great photo.
The name *shira-ito* means "white threads" and indeed the water spiders
over the rock as it woven from white threads.
Curiously approaching the falls there were several "parking full" even
though there was plenty of parking: very strange, I have no idea.

We continue further up the mountain as the road opens up on rural 
communities, most flat land is in agriculture with forests of straight pines,
and some broad rivers running through the valleys. 
At a crossroads we stopped for a quick lunch at
[Matchan's vegetables direct sales](https://macchan.co.jp/ "やさい直売所 マッちゃん")
a cross between a truck stop and farmer's co-op filled with all kinds of
local produce. 
We bought handmade tofu still warm and it was absolutely delicious: 
very flavorful with a delicate semi-firm texture, the best tofu I've had.

### [珈道庵 Kodouan](https://www.kodouan.com/)

Our destination was a coffee roaster — not a coffee shop — in the most
remote location. Why roast coffee in such an out of the way place,
so far from anything and off the beaten path? (I still don't know why.)
Already following windy mountain roads through very small villages,
the route took us through even more remote settings but small signs
for the place confirmed we were on the right track.
Turning into the driveway it was 700m on a single lane unpaved road,
arriving to see a couple of beautiful buildings that look like a high-end
traditional restaurant or inn. One building was the shop, the other open
for sitting down to enjoy coffee with a beautiful wooded stream running by.

The shop has many varieties and blends of coffee, elegantly packaged
individually or as gift sets like you might buy Japanese tea or other
delicacies. Prices ran from expensive to extravegant — one set was almost
JPY 60,000 (about USD $400) for three 100g (3.5 ounce) packages.
We ordered some (less expensive) coffee to try prepared by hand;
since they aren't a coffee shop we got full size cups with a sweet snack
that we could not pay for. All they sell is coffee. 
The display packages of coffee were all ground but on order they made
whole bean packages for me to take back to friends at Kauai Roastery.
