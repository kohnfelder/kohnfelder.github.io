I left Kaua‘i for Honolulu to the long flight to Fukuoka (FUK).
Following the Alaska Airlines buyout of Hawaiian Airlines
this route ends later this year so this will be my last direct flight.
Nice surprise seeing the documentary [Aletha](https://hiff.org/events/aletha/)
(one of the films from the Hawai‘i International Film Festival) featuring
our late friend Aletha Goodwin Kaohi of Waimea. From my time visiting the
island I met Aletha at the visitor center she headed for many years, and
got to know her and meet many others through her connections. 
Her walking tours of Waimea were legendary and quite interesting. When we built
the house she generously performed the house blessing ceremony for us.

Fukuoka airport is quite close to downtown, but traffic getting around the
airport is slow but it wasn't too bad. We went to a tempura restaurant
for dinner and headed to our rental place in Itoshima.
