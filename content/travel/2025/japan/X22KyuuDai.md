I was invited to visit the 
[university](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/university/)
and meet some graduate students of the
[Cybersecurity center](https://cs.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/) 
to learn about their research projects.

I introduced myself and then heard three presentations of research projects,
answering questions and commenting or offering some ideas that might help.
The students were engaged and friendly, and we had some good discussions.

Later we took a bus to the train station and had a nice dinner
at the *izakaya* [Wa No Kuni](https://kanko-itoshima.jp/spot/wanokuni/).
