## Itoshima craft festival

Today we visited the annual craft festival that showcases the work of
the local creative community in booths set up in a large public park.
All kinds of artistic work is displayed and on sale, including
pottery, fabrics, accessories, jewelry, leather goods, woodwork, and more.
For kids there are opportunities to make art with colorful supplies,
put together kits, and other participation activities.
