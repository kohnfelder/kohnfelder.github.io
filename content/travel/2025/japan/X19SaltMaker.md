## Salt Maker

Visiting the northwest corner of Itoshima.

### Mount Tateishi

This morning we headed for Tateishi-san 立石山 (210m) to see a view
of west Itoshima. Following navigation the last turn looked like we
were entering a private unpaved driveway but that turned out to be the way.
Soon the road was paved again, but it continued narrow and notably for Japan
poorly maintained with weeds and tree branches encrouching on the
road. Eventually the road topped out at a small dirt parking area
with a trailhead - no other cars on the road or parked, nobody else there.

Heading up the fairly steep path we found the trail even more poorly
maintained than the road. Stairs had been installed long ago but with
erosion these had degraded into a kind of obstacle course, with vertical
pieces in place but the horizontal stair part gone: a serious hazard for
injury if you fell on one of that stakes. Thankfully a few sturdy ropes had
been installed along the worst stretches making it manageable without undue
risk. 

We found a nice view about halfway up and decided it wasn't worth the effort
to go all the way to the top.

### Salt Maker Mataichi

Continuing on the same poor road we descended to the coastline on the far side.
Turning north we headed to the end of the road to see salt making at
[Mataichi](https://mataichi.info/tottan/).

The work place looks ancient, filled with old industrial equipment
and they were working but visitors were not allowed inside.
There isn't a tour as it must be hot and probably dangerous wandering
around the place.

Seawater is pumped and circulated through this apparatus for ten days
to concentrate a 10% brine. Bamboo hangs from the wooden frame in this
traditional salt-making method.
