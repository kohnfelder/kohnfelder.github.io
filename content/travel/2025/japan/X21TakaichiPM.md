## Sanae Takaichi elected prime minister of Japan

Today the Diet elected 
[Sanae Takaichi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanae_Takaichi) 
to be Japan's next prime minister after months of political machinations.

*(Note the glum expression of a bitter rival seated immediately behind her.)*

Takaichi leads the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that has dominated
post-war politics in Japan but recently fallen in popularity losing its
majority in the Diet a few years ago and struggling ever since with
persistent accusations of improper financial transactions.

Outgoing prime minister Ishiba has continued to lose power and decline
since being elected but resisted resigning and stubbornly clung to the
office, which has delayed and complicated the process of choosing a successor.
Takaichi won the party presidency over a month ago - usually this would
automatically mean becoming prime minister - except the coalition with the
Komeito party that allowed Ishiba to gain a majority soon faltered.

Eventually Takaichi forged a new coalition with the 
Japan Innovation Party (日本維新の会）to procure the necessary votes
to beome prime minister. 
According to reporting cabinet seats were offered to the coalition
partner but were declined (perhaps because the relatively new party members
are relatively inexperienced, or perhaps due to lack of confidence in the
new government).

Japan's new prime minister is a woman with an unusual background. 
As a young woman Takaichi was into heavy metal rock music. Accepted
into elite colleges she did not attend because her parents refused to fund
her education living away from home (apparently considering higher education
not some important for a woman). Instead she went to the best university
commuting several hours a day while continuing to live at home.
She worked as in American on staff of a member of congress before
returning to Japan to pursue a career in politics. Married to another
politician, they divorced it is said over political differences and
subsequently remarried with him taking her surname (in Japan spouses
are not allowed to have different surnames).

With the political maneuvering behind here, not PM Takaichi will get to work
and we will see if the new government delivers results or not.
